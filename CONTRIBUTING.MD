# Contribution Guidelines

see something missing or have an idea on how this project can be improved? Feel free to open an issue.

If you want to contribute directly, we greatly appreciate any help. We need help with everything from writing better documentation, to making changes that implement best practices, to porting precise to tensorflow 2 and using it directly rather than calling it via the commandline. No matter your skill level, no matter your specialty, we probably have something you can help with.

That being said, please open an issue or comment on an existing one, before starting work on a PR. this makes things easier for everyone involved.

We are working on documentation for each of the files in data prep, and once those are done we will link them here.
