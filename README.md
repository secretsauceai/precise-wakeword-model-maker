# wakeword-data-prep
This is a work in progress! 

After collecting your wake word data set with the [wakeword data collection tool](https://github.com/AmateurAcademic/wakeword-recorder-py), you can use this tool to:
* optimally split the test/training set (and test this split)
* automatically select best base model
* generate Gaussian noise
* generate background noise
* incrementally train through other noise (ie common voice, pd)

NOTE: The model analytics doesn't always pick the best-best model, a refactor is on the way to ensure that the best models are always picked. But it still performs better than anything I have ever seen so....

# How does it work?
TODO: come up with really chill explaination about data categories, sub-categories they boost the model, optimizing model selection and training, noisy data generation, automatically incrementally collecting new data, and curriculum learning. 

## Usage: 
* After following the instructions to install from the [Mycroft Precise readme](https://github.com/secretsauceai/precise-wakeword-model-maker#source-install) (skip over the git clone part, I assume you have git cloned this repo!), go into your venv (ie source .venv/source/bin/activate) and run `pip install -r requirements_data_prep.txt --force-reinstall` (there seems to currently be an issue with some of the requirements from the original precise not working with current versions of certain packages)
* configure the  `data_prep_user_configuration.json` with the relative paths: 
	* `audio_source_directory` (the main directory for the recordings from `wakeword_recorder`, 
	* `wakeword_model_name` the name you want to give the wakeword model,
    * `pdsounds_directory` the directory to the mp3 (or wav) files: [pdsounds](http://pdsounds.tuxfamily.org/),
	* `extra_audio_directories_to_process`, which are all of the extra audio datasets you have downloaded besides pdsounds,
* and run `data_prep_ide.py`. 

##  Data
It is important to note that downloading a lot of noise data is vital to producing a bullet proof wake word model. In addition it is important to note that data prep does not walk through sub directories of sound files. It only processes the top level directory. It is best to just dump audio files in the top level directory. The files can be in mp3 or wav format, data prep will convert them to wav with the the sample rate of `16000`.
* [pdsounds](http://pdsounds.tuxfamily.org/)
* [Precise community data](https://github.com/MycroftAI/Precise-Community-Data)
* [Open Path Music Data](https://archive.org/download/OpenPathMusic44V5/OpenPathMusic44V5.zip)
* [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets/) or from the [Kagle Common Voice](https://www.kaggle.com/mozillaorg/common-voice) dataset

This is still a work in progress. 


## ToDO
* ~~in `test_train_split()` change paragraph and variations to an even/odd split instead of random~~
* ~~in `run_precise_train` how do you run the training properly (in command line: precise-train) from the class or otherwise? It seems to run with only one parameter where we have `precise-train -e 350 self.experiment_path_01 experiment_01.net`~~
* ~~refactor code for repeatitive code~~
* ~~in the `wakeword-data-collector` change variations to be stored in their own sub dir in `wake-word/variations`~~
* ~~get the results of running precise-train `accuracy` and `val_accuracy`~~
* ~~iteratively run 5 experiments saving the results~~
* ~~compare results to select best model based on `accuracy` and `val_accuracy`~~
* ~~add in proper split for other categories (ie paragraph), instead of random~~
* ~~delete unused experiments directories~~ (still need to clean up the precise model files generated)
* ~~adding noise~~
    * ~~Gaussian noise~~
    * ~~background noise (precise-add-noise)~~
* Refactor model analytics and choosing the best model
* Refactor the training function to pass both measures: the default `loss` and `val_loss`
* Test smaller batch sizes and scaling them up
* test output models (both tf1.13 and tflite) for production
   * hope this one passes 
* CLI stuff
* Clean up code (again!)
